Main questions:
  1.What data?
  2.From where we should take data?
  3.How to store the data?
  4.What to do with data?
  5.How to present data?
  6.Next steps to do

1. What data?
  Current Categories, Winners, Nominees, 
  My suggestions(SB):   Score(Tomatometer,Audience score from rottentomatoes/metascore from metacritics, score from imdb )
                        Budget
                        Total number of nominations for a film
                        Country of origin(?)

2. From where we should take data?
 Wikipedia: main data
     Plus: easy to navigate 
           we know there is all the basic data we need
           we can get all the precise data from here(budget, country of origin...)
     Cons: maybe too easy for the project

 Rottentomatoes: main data + critics score
    Plus: less easy
    Cons: Dynamic site therefore harder to get the data

  Kaggle data set: https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/the-oscar-award
    Plus: Acces through API therefore we can show that we are able to do that, and still not that hard as accesing the dynamic page
    Cons: Not all the data we need. 

  Metacritics: critics score

  IMBD:  imdb score

3. How to store the data?
    csv data table and working with pandas dataframe to get together data from different sources

4. What to do with data?
    Basic statistics: Most succesfull countries, Men ws Women winners, Average budget of films in 2021 dollars, correlation between critics choice and winners
    Advance statistics: Different correlations, maybe some distributions.
    Hypothesis testing: TBA we can find some interesting hypothesis emerging from basic and advance statistics

5. How to present data?
    Using Jupyter Notebook, basic graph plotting, maybe some map with different colours from most to less succesfull countries...

6. Next steps
    Chosing the sources of data
    Creating flowchart
