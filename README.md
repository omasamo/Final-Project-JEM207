# Final-Project-JEM207
Final project for JEM207 Data Processing with Python
We scrape from oscars.org site historical datasets of every nominees for the following 6 awards:

>
> Best Director (1927-2021)
> Best Actor (1927-2021)
> Best Actress (1927-2021)

Each dataset would be indexed by year and category.

The websites used for the following datas are: 
rottentomatoes, Imdb, bafta, wikipedia.
> Wikipedia would be used only for data which were not provided by the
> other websites.
> The information collected on the movies would be : title,
> rottentomatoes, Imdb and metascore score, budget, country of origin,
> total number of nominations to the Oscars, winner or not of the
> category and BAFTA result.
> The information collected on the individuals would be : names, age at
> the time of the nomination, gender, previously nominated to the
> Oscars.

Based on these data, we would like to present various statistics such
> as the average budget for each year, the impact of certain variables
> such as age on the chance of winning an award, and some
> visualizations, such as the main winning countries of the Best
> International Feature Film Award.
