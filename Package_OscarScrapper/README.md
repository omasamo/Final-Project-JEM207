# Final-Project-JEM207
Final project for JEM207 Data Processing with Python
We scrape from oscars.org site historical datasets of every nominees for the following 6 awards:
>
> Best Visual Effects (1939-2021)
> Best International Feature Film (1947-2021)
> Best Picture (1927-2021)
> 
> Best Director (1927-2021)
> Best Actor (1927-2021)
> Best Actress (1927-2021)

Each dataset would be indexed by year and category.

The websites used for the following datas are: 
rottentomatoes, Imdb, bafta, wikipedia.
 Wikipedia would be used only for data which were not provided by the other websites. The information collected on the movies would be : title, rottentomatoes, Imdb and metascore score, budget, country of origin, total number of nominations to the Oscars, winner or not of the category and BAFTA result. The information collected on the individuals would be : names, age at the time of the nomination, gender, previously nominated to the Oscars.

Based on these data, we would like to present various statistics such as the average budget for each year, the impact of certain variables such as age on the chance of winning an award, and some visualizations, such as the main winning countries of the Best International Feature Film Award.


Notes from WIP:

string familiarity library python

json save the progress + raise Error pour Scrapping

focus to the end :

full documentation !!
executable project: one script executable 
jupyter is good for exploratory + presentation, but "professional" = script executable
MAKE IT INSTALLABLE : PYTHON PACKAGE

File that is an example of the use of the project
documentation information in lecture 9
